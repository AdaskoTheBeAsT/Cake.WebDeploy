## Plays well with

If your looking to manage IIS its worth checking out [Cake.IIS](https://github.com/SharpeRAD/Cake.IIS) or if your running a WebFarm inside AWS then check out [Cake.AWS.ElasticLoadBalancing](https://github.com/SharpeRAD/Cake.AWS.ElasticLoadBalancing).

If your looking for a way to trigger cake tasks based on windows events or at scheduled intervals then check out [Cake.CakeBoss](https://github.com/SharpeRAD/CakeBoss).
